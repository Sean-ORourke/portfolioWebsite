        <h3>HLSL Shader Creation in Unity URP</h3>

<p>
  This project is a custom outline shader written in HLSL using Unity’s ShaderLab
  syntax for the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). I created it as a focused
  learning exercise to gain hands-on experience with HLSL, shader fundamentals,
  and Unity’s Universal Render Pipeline.
</p>

<h3>Editor Adjustable Attributes</h3>

  alt="Material Attributes in Unity Editor."

<p>
  My outline shader has several adjustable attributes which can be changed in the
  material editor. This allows the user of the material to easily customize the
  shader’s behavior without modifying code.
</p>

<ul style="margin-top: -50px;">
  <li>
    I enjoyed learning about toggles, which enables the user to toggle the outline
    on and off, and switch between a procedurally determined outline color or a
    manually selected one.
  </li>

  <li>
    For the procedurally determined border color, I used the <code>dot()</code>
    function to calculate the grayscale luminance value of the base color, and
    then used that luminance value to drive a <code>lerp()</code> blend for the
    outline color.
  </li>

  <li>
    Additionally, the user of the material can adjust the base color, select a
    texture, modify texture tiling, and control the width of the outline.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>In Progress and Future Directions</h3>

<p>
  My goal for this project was to learn the fundamentals of HLSL and ShaderLab by
  throwing myself into the process and learning through iteration. I now feel I
  have a solid understanding of variable declaration, data types, structs,
  interpolators, and per-vertex versus per-fragment logic in HLSL.
</p>

<p>
  I also learned several important conventions and optimizations, such as
  utilizing floats instead of booleans for toggles, and using the
  <code>lerp()</code> function with a 0/1 value instead of an if/else statement. I
  implemented this approach after learning that avoiding branching logic is
  generally more GPU-friendly. Using floats instead of booleans also allows these
  values to be directly composed into mathematical functions like
  <code>lerp()</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, I learned how human perceptual weighting of RGB channels applies
  to perceived luminance in the digital RGBA color spectrum, and how to account
  for this using weighted modifiers inside the <code>dot()</code> function.
  Experimenting with multiple implementations helped reinforce these conventions
  and gave me a more intuitive understanding of how shader math translates to
  visual results.
</p>

<img

  alt="Sphere Intersecting with Border."
/>

<p>
  One known issue is that intersecting geometry can become visible inside the
  outline, breaking the illusion of a solid border. With more time, I would
  address this using depth-based techniques or stencil buffer approaches to
  ensure the outline remains visually solid, even in close-up or narrative-driven
  scenes.

            Magician Match
        </h1>

        <p>Magician Match is an unreleased educational memory and pattern following game developed by Simcoach Games. 
            A special thank you to the studio, as Simcoach Games has allowed me to share assets and visuals I created for their properties during my employment at the studio for portfolio purposes.</p>
        
            <p> In this game, players take on the role of a magician's apprentice, Arel, who helps the magician "Magic Moon" perform magic tricks by collecting items as requested and setting them in the proper order. 
            The game features vibrant 2D art, engaging "magic trick" animations, and special effects to create an joyful and motivating experience. 
            I was responsible for creating all placeholder and finalized art assets, rigging and animating characters, and implementing particle effects. 
            Magcian Match demonstrates breadth in my artistic skills, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: -50px;">
                <li>2D Character Design, and Puppet Creation</li>
                <li>2D Character Rigging, Weight Painting, and Animation</li>
                <li>2D Environmental and Object Asset Creation</li>
                <li>Visual Effects Creation using Particle Systems</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>This breadth in skill and experience enables me to understand the needs of the artists I work with, and better aid in their issues.</p>
            <p>Below are some examples of the work I created for Magician Match.</p>
