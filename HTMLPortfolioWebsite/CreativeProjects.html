        <p>I want to demonstrate how flexible walls show the creativity of renters, accommodating for extenuating life
            circumstances, to create a better space for themselves. I will argue that temporary walls allow for more
            living options for renters, and more options are often beneficial as long as renters are aware of the
            detriments as well as the benefits such a decision could bring. I also want to comment on how flexible walls
            are heavily restricted by New York City Housing Authority (Rent Own Sell New York), and landlords, to ensure
            that all bedroom spaces fit proper bedroom standards. Finally, I will explore how pricing, regulation, and
            renter desires are in tension in this complicated housing market.</p>

        <p>From my research, many have done research on this topic by living it - they have created content of
            themselves
            putting up temporary walls - walkthroughs of their apartment with a temporary wall in it. Temporary wall
            companies make videos and websites to explain what temporary walls are, what different types are, and (of
            course) follow it up with their price points. I am adding to this conversation by consolidating a
            generalized
            overview. This allows viewers to get a broader context of the options, without nessicarily living it.</p>

        <p>I realized when creating a video essay, I often think of the literal essay first. Then, all of the visuals,
            sound, and gags as I am editing the essay. Creating the video essay is very much separated into two parts in
            this way.</p>
        <p>Suggestions from my peers aided me in adding extra information on what viewers may want, leading me to put
            more
            emphasis on wall customization options, and price. Visual feedback from peers aided me in enhancing the
            visual
            clarity of wall diagrams with aids - like circling where the pressurized walls pressed against the permanent
            walls. Finally, compliments from peers inspired me to continue refining, and be confident in my video essay.
            Thank you to all my reviewers!

        </div>
        <h3>Where did we come from?</h3>
        <p>MySpokenSchedules! originated as a response to Sean’s hilarious inefficiencies in managing daily alarms and
            schedules. Thus, Dev Team 14 aimed to create a tool that could streamline notifications and daily schedules.
            The project started with detailed user personas to guide development: a haphazard college student, a busy
            professional, and a parent with a hectic schedule. These personas illustrated diverse needs, ranging from
            schedule organization to personalized alarms and reminders, which laid the foundation for the app’s key
            tasks.
            Initial goals included customizable task sounds, including dynamic voice reminders, playlist playing
            functionalities, and schedule lists. Schedules were intended to have non-repeating, day-repeating, and other
            types of repetitions.
            Early iterations of the app focused on the visual layout - we only dove into data storage midway through.
        </p>

        <h3>Where did we go?</h3>
        <p>Throughout development, we managed actual data storage for task creation, editing, and schedule management.
            Alpha and beta versions of the app showcased clear progress, incorporating feedback to improve user
            interactions and refine functionalities.
            The app’s task system evolved to support label customization, message inputs, and specific time triggers.
            Schedules allowed users to group tasks, assign them to particular days, and toggle their activation.
            Notifications were refined to include dynamic AI voice readouts, providing clarity without requiring users
            to touch their phones.
            As the project advanced, key challenges such as emulator compatibility and the limitations of using Flutter
            on non-Apple devices prompted pivots in design and functionality. Features were tested rigorously through
            consultant sessions, ensuring they aligned with user needs.</p>

        <h3>Why Scaled Down, Changed, or Removed?</h3>
        <p>Adjustments were necessary to maintain focus and meet deadlines:
            Spotify API and Sound Features: Originally envisioned as part of the app’s audio functionality, integrating
            Spotify proved unfeasible due to the absence of an official API and its complexity. This feature was scaled
            down to AI-generated voice readouts, which directly addressed the app’s core goal of delivering meaningful
            notifications.
            Location-Based Notifications: This feature was removed to streamline development and focus on time-based
            triggers, which were deemed more critical by users.
            Task Photos/Icons: While users expressed interest in customization options for icons, this feature was
            deprioritized to avoid scope creep. We did, however, ensure emojis worked in task and schedule creation -
            including them in the default “New Task” and “New Schedule” - so users could still have visual references
            for their tasks.
            These decisions allowed us to focus on delivering a cohesive experience, emphasizing the essential features
            to make schedules that are spoken and customizable. </p>

        <h3>Lessons Learned?</h3>
        <p>The development of MySpokenSchedules! highlighted several key lessons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Scope Management:</strong> Focusing on a manageable scope ensured the completion of core
                features while maintaining quality. The removal of complex functionalities like Spotify integration
                demonstrated the importance of aligning deliverables with project constraints.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Feedback is Crucial:</strong> User testing sessions revealed unexpected insights, such as
                the importance of simple visual features (light/dark mode) and intuitive design elements like the
                Android time selector widget.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Technical Readiness:</strong> Early setup of development environments, including compatibility
                with emulators, is vital for minimizing technical roadblocks. Our team had initially planned to do iOS
                development - however, realizing that Xcode did not work on non-Mac laptops, and that some laptops
                struggle to get an emulator up in a timely manner, delayed development.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Collaboration and Modularity:</strong> Assigning special features, like the AI-voice or
                Notifications, to particular team members ensured accountability and decreased the amount of research
                the team had to be familiar with as a whole.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is MySpokenSchedules! now?</h3>
        <p>MySpokenSchedules! is a scheduling tool that provides dynamic voice notifications, customizable task
            creation, and flexible schedule management. Users can create schedules that align with their routines, set
            personalized messages for tasks, and receive AI-generated voice reminders at specified times. The app
            prioritizes a distraction-free experience, allowing users to stay on track without needing to interact
            directly with their devices.
            While some features from the initial vision were scaled back, the app successfully delivers on its core
            promises, making it a valuable tool for users seeking an intuitive and efficient scheduling solution. It
            reflects a thoughtful balance between ambitious goals and practical constraints, embodying our commitment to
            user-centric design and iterative improvement.
